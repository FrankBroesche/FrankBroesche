# STIG Implementation Scripts

This folder contains PowerShell scripts developed during my cybersecurity internship to implement Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) controls on Windows systems.

Each script focuses on a specific set of configurations and is commented where possible to explain what it does and which STIG ID it addresses.

> **Note:** These scripts are for educational and demonstration purposes. Test in a safe environment before applying them in production.
